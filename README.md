Project Overview
This project analyzes airline punctuality and flight delays to identify factors influencing on-time performance. The dataset includes flight schedules, delays, cancellations, and airport performance data. The analysis is performed using Power BI, with data cleaning in SQL/Python.

Objective
- Understand the causes of flight delays and cancellations.
- Identify airlines with the best/worst on-time performance.
- Analyze peak hours and routes prone to delays.
- Detect seasonal or weather-related trends affecting punctuality.

Dataset
- Source: (Specify if from Kaggle, FAA, etc.)
- Columns Included: Flight Number, Airline, Departure Time, Arrival Time, Delay Duration, Cancellations, Weather Conditions, etc.

Key Insights
- Most common causes of delays: Weather, air traffic congestion, mechanical issues.
- Airlines with the best/worst performance: (Insert findings here).
- Peak delay periods: Flights in the evening and during holidays have higher delays.
- Airport impact: Some airports experience more delays due to traffic volume.

Tools Used
- Power BI → Data visualization & dashboard creation
- SQL → Data cleaning and transformation

How to Use
- Download the dataset from the Data folder.
- Open the Power BI file (.pbix) in Power BI Desktop.
- Explore the interactive dashboard for insights.
